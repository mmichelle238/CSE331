# Sample testing file.
# Tests that a graph can be created, a pair of nodes and
# an edge between them can be added, and a pair of nodes
# and a single edge can be printed out.

# We provide this test purely for you to verify your
# implementation of a variety of test script commands.
# This is NOT an example of a properly low-granularity test
# case, nor is it intended to be! Your tests, unlike this
# one, should only test one condition per file. The name and
# comments of your files should describe the condition being tested.

# Create a graph
CreateGraph graph1

# Add a pair of nodes
AddNode graph1 n1
AddNode graph1 n2

# Add an edge
AddEdge graph1 n1 n2 e1

# Print the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges from n1
ListNodes graph1
