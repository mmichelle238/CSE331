# create a graph and 3 nodes and create edges
# between them. This test ensures that the list
# of the children of a node is sorted alphabetically

created graph A
added node n1 to A
added node n2 to A
added node n3 to A
added edge e31 from n3 to n2 in A
added edge e32 from n3 to n1 in A
added edge e33 from n3 to n3 in A
the children of n3 in A are: n1(e32) n2(e31) n3(e33)
A contains: n1 n2 n3
