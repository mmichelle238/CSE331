# Sample testing file
# Tests graph creation/viewing with a
# simple graph ('A') with three nodes.  Also tests
# that the simultaneous creation of another graph
# ('B') does not result in incorrect behavior.

# We provide this test purely for you to verify your
# implementation of a variety of test script commands.
# This is NOT an example of a properly low-granularity test
# case, nor is it intended to be! Your tests, unlike this
# one, should only test one condition per file. The name and
# comments of your files should describe the condition being tested.
