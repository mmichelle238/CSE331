 * IntQueue1 is our first implementation of a basic first-in, first-out queue for Integers.

 * in the queue and is the next item to be removed. n_k is the most-recently-added and will be the
 * last of the current elements to be removed.
 *
 * <p>An IntQueue can also be described constructively, with the append operation, ':', such that
 * [n1, n2, ..., n_k] : n_k+1 is the result of enqueing n_k+1 at the end of the queue.
