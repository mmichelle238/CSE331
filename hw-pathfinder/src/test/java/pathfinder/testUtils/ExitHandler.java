/**
 * DO NOT MODIFY
 * <p>
 * You shouldn't modify or move this class at all. It exists to allow JUnit
 * tests to call methods that might System.exit() without causing JUnit or
 * Gradle to crash. In general, System.exit() should never be called during
 * a test - it means something is very wrong. However, sometimes it makes sense
 * to have it in your main code that might be tested. If it ever gets called,
 * however, the test should fail.
 * <p>
 * Without this class in place, calling System.exit() will cause the entire
 * testing system to shut down without running any other tests. We definitely
 * don't want this. Instead, we want just that one test to fail. We do that
 * by throwing an exception - which the JUnit system will catch and fail without
 * crashing completely.
