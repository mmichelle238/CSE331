# Find a path with Dijkstra's algorithm when
# the path found by BFS is different. The weights are also
# very similar.

created graph simpleGraph

added node A to simpleGraph
added node B to simpleGraph
added node C to simpleGraph
added node D to simpleGraph

added edge 3.456 from A to B in simpleGraph
added edge 1.534 from A to C in simpleGraph
added edge 1.563 from C to D in simpleGraph
added edge 0.545 from D to B in simpleGraph

path from A to B:
A to B with weight 3.456
total cost: 3.456
