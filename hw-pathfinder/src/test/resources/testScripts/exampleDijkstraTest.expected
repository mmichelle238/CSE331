# Find a path with Dijkstra's algorithm when
# the path found by BFS is different.

created graph simpleGraph

added node A to simpleGraph
added node B to simpleGraph
added node C to simpleGraph
added node D to simpleGraph

added edge 10.000 from A to B in simpleGraph
added edge 1.000 from A to C in simpleGraph
added edge 1.000 from C to D in simpleGraph
added edge 1.000 from D to B in simpleGraph

path from A to B:
A to C with weight 1.000
C to D with weight 1.000
D to B with weight 1.000
total cost: 3.000
