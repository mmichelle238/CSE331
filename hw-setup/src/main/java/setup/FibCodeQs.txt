1. Fibonacci failed the testThrowsIllegalArgumentException test because it should only throw the exception if it's negative.
I fixed this by changing the first if statement to n<0 from n<=0.
2. Fibonacci failed the testBaseCase test because it should return 1 if n is 0 or 1.
I fixed this by changing the the else if statement from n<=2 to n<=1.
3. Fibonacci failed the testInductiveCase test because it was subtracting the two previous numbers.
I fixed this by changing the last line of code in the else statement to add the two previous numbers.
